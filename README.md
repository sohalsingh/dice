# dice

This Python code simulates rolling a standard six-sided dice. It generates a random number between 1 and 6, simulating the outcome of rolling the dice. The code utilizes the `random` module in Python.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. Copy the code from the provided Python script and save it in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `dice.py`).

3. Run the script using a Python interpreter or an integrated development environment (IDE). This will execute the `roll_dice()` function, which simulates the dice roll and returns a random number between 1 and 6.

4. The result of the dice roll will be displayed in the output. It will indicate the number rolled by the dice.

```python
The dice rolled: 3
```

5. You can call the `roll_dice()` function multiple times to simulate rolling the dice multiple times.

## Customization

If you want to simulate a dice with a different number of sides, you can modify the code by adjusting the parameters passed to `random.randint()` function within the `roll_dice()` function. For example, to simulate a ten-sided dice, you can change the line `return random.randint(1, 6)` to `return random.randint(1, 10)`.

Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different dice simulations based on your needs.
